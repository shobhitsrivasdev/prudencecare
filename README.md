## About the Project

A versatile Java program for  healthcare management system called 'Prudence Care.'

Patients use this program as a one-stop shop for all of their healthcare requirements, including hospital visits, lab tests, pharmacy needs, and insurance coverage. It processes insurance coverage automatically and keeps track of patient medical records. Additionally, this tool aids in the testing of novel medications, their tracking and facilitation, and their FDA approval. Once approved, the medicine is sent to be mass produced by the drug manufacturing company and is then sold in pharmacies.
